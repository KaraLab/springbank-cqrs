# springbank-cqrs
An experimental repo. I learned the core concepts of CQRS and event sourcing using the axon framework

This was a tough one. I implemented a user and bank service by following the CQRS and event sourcing pattern. I had a hard time figuring out how axon works yet I still have open questions.

I provided two architectural overviews about the software. The first one is a high level overview over the hole system and the other one shows what happens in the user domain. The bank domain works basically in the same way.

NOTE: docker-compose-yml is currently incomplete. I will provide the missing part later.
